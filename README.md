# Product Description
SurveysAPI is a JSON REST API for creating, modifying, and submitting surveys. A survey is an ordered list of survey questions. Supported types of questions include:
- Text Entry (free form) (ex: "What is your name")
- Multiple Choice (ex: "Which color do you like the best? Choose one: [Orange, Green, Blue, Red]")
- Date (ex: "What is your birthdate?")
  - NOTE this is _not_ Datetime. This is date-only. Answering this kind of question should not specify a time; It should only specify a calendar date.

# Challenge Overview
This challenge has two parts (instructions for each appear below):
1. Coding Portion
2. Written Portion (Please see response under Response section.)

Submission Instructions:
- Clone this repository and create your own remote to push it to.
- Implement the coding portion.
- Include your response to the written portion in the README.
- When ready, invite me (patrick.wickham@alcoverooms.com) to your remote.
  - Note: I will not look at git history.

# Coding Portion Instructions
## Requirements
Implement REST APIÂ endpoints (JSON) for the following pieces of functionality:
- Create a survey
  - See "Product Description" for types of questions you must support
- Modify a previously created survey
  - Add/Remove questions
  - Modify a question
  - Reorder questions
  - Change options for a Multiple Choice question
- Submit to a survey (eg take the survey)

You may organize the code however you see fit, including creating/moving files/folders.

In addition to the code, please also provide _brief_ overview of its usage, so I can see the API design. This can come in the form of comments, README, or an external script that demonstrates the use of each endpoint.

### Note:
These are just use cases, not necessarily API endpoints. Your API can have as many endpoints as you see fit.

## Tech Specs
- Must be runnable on a Node version >v10
- Must be pure nodejs (no typescript)
- You may use NPM libraries, but you should implement the core logic yourself. The goal is to see how you design & implement the logic.
  - You may email me at patrick.wickham@alcoverooms.com if you aren't sure
- Must be runnable as Express server using `npm run dev` script and accessible locally on port 3001
  - This is already provided

## Getting Started
- Clone this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

## You will be graded on:
- API Design (Usability for clients)
- Code Readability
- Overall Simplicty
- Extensibility
#### Example questions you should ask to evaluate your submission (but not implement):
(This list is not exhaustive)
- How easy would it be for a new contributor to pick up the project?
- How easy would it be to plug in a database layer? 
- How easy would it be to add another type of survey question?
- How easy would it be to add other new features (search surveys / submissions, list submissions, store user data, etc)?
## You will NOT be graded on
- Performance (Readable code > Optimized code)
- Implementation of out-of-scope features
## Out of scope
(You may do these if you like, but they are not required or graded)
- Using a database or any persistent storage
- User management or identities (Assume API is used "anonymously" ie as a private service)
- Authentication
- Frontend
- Formal documentation

# Written Portion Instructions
Create a brief summary (one-paragraph, or bulleted list) of what you'd need to do in order to make this app production-ready (eg pretend this is a real SAAS).
- (This should _not_ include possible new features; assume the provided feature set is complete).

### Getting this app production-ready

Create a set of guidelines with internal team to determine what is considered "production-ready."  To transition from development to production mode, consider aligning standards and approaches for the following areas:
- Through code reviews, follow consistent naming conventions, discuss how to best handle error-handling, maintain readability,etc. (assuming that bottlenecks, single-points-of-failure, issues such as scalability/reliability/latency have been factored into the greater system design before implementing code)
- Where and how to document decisions and thought processes
- Testing (ie. unit, integration)/TDD
- Determine workflow for CI/CD, how to regularly evaluate performance

Once guidelines are set and code quality verified:
- Register for an URL/DNS
- Upload documents and have app be publicly available
- Establish a hosting service (may be on the cloud) which would take care of holding onto the app's documents and running the server, handle load balancing, traffic routing, service discovery, health checks, etc.


### Design Considerations

The API system has been built as a CRUD interface that enables HTTP requests to be stored in a flat-file database.  It accounts for extensibility by maintaining the flexibility for engineers to modify the functionality of each route or controller. The routes are written to accommodate a variety of question types, beyond the ones outlined under Product Description, that can be asked on any survey.  Currently, this system is written so that it receives some instructions from the frontend on how each CRUD operation should relay information to the backend.  However, details such as how the user takes the survey/enters responses, specification of question types, whether the questions are reordered through a dnd interface, or other interpretation of json are assumed to be handled by some kind of frontend component framework.

Testing of routes were performed through PostMan:
1) Adding a question to a new survey:

2) Adding a response:

3) Editing a question:

4) Reordering a question:

5) Delete a question:

### Future Implementation

Validation - question types and responses (logic written in pseudocode under controller.js).

Verifying question types: Validate that question types are in strings.  If, for example, a question type is "mc" (multiple choice), make sure that the question has "options" as a key and an array of strings as the corresponding value.

Verifying responses: First, expect that the req.body.response is an object.  Then check if each key's corresponding value represents a valid id in the data store, meaning that the response is an answer to an existing question in the survey.  Optional: for every key that has an invalid id, remove that key-value pair.

Verifying response type: Example scenarios to determine whether questions can be added to survey
- If question type is date or textheck, check if each response is in a string or desired format (can use regex).  If not, question is not added.  
- If question type is "mc" (multiple choice) but has no options, question is not added.
